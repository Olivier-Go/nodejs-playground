# Node.js Multiplayer Drawing Board.
## How it works?
Once new users are connecting on the game, new mouse cursors will appear and moving around your drawing board. You'll see everything instantaneously.
## How to play:
  * Install dependencies running `npm install`
  * Then execute `node app.js`
  * Finally, access it on your favorite browser (except if your favorite browser is IE6): http://localhost:8080/
